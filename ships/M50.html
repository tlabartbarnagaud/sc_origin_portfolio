    <h2 id="history">History</h2>

    <h3>Early Development</h3>
    <p>In 2918-07-13, the final concept of M50 was completed by the Origin junior designer Alberto Vara and engineer Javo Croy.</p>
    <p>Before its reveal, the prototype and Y-series test ships are plagued with difficulties. Re-purposed for the 890 Jump, the 85x, originally Model XVB, went through rigorous tests along other cutting-edge speedsters to find the model that would ultimately become the M50.</p>
    <p>In 2920, The first of M50 were unveiled at the Imperial Engineering Expo in Prime. Constructed as a spiritual successor to Origin's legendary X Sport, the first M50 was an attempt to reclaim Origin's dominance on the racetrack. The public's interest in their ship flagged, causing a slow and steady decline in sales.</p>

    <h3>First Murray Cup win</h3>
    <p>In 2923, the M50 wins its first Murray Cup in the hands of former Origin test pilot Caleb Arlo. The victory establishes the M50 as a dynamic and versatile speed machine.</p>

    <h3>Advocacy Adoption</h3>
    <p>In 2936, the UEE Advocacy secretly met with ship manufacturers and presented their parameters for an ideal interdiction ship. To the surprise of many, Origin Jumpworks' pitch of the M50 seemed to satisfy all requirements. The commission worked closely with Origin on minor tweaks before bulk buying a shipment for their new elite unit; the Bronson's Bolt.</p>
    <p>In 2938, the Advocacy purchased a bulk of these racers to convert into interdiction ships. This modified version of the M50 wasn't the fastest or most powerful ship proposed to the Advocacy, it balanced both better than the alternatives with the right loadout. These custom models became notorious among outlaw packs, several of whom had open bounties available for anyone who would risk the wrath of the Advocacy by destroying one.</p>

    <h3>Present</h3>
    <p>In 2945, as the M50's 25th anniversary approached, the ship was redesigned with more than 600 modifications.</p>
    <p>The details about the Advocacy modifications to the M50 remain classified, and though a few of these ships have fallen into the hands of outlaws, no one, other than those deputized by the Advocacy, has been able to replicate the changes on a standard M50.</p>

    <p>The Origin M50 Interceptor is a small single seat racing ship that doubles as an interdiction ship. It is often referred to as a power plant with a cockpit attached. Introduced in 2920, it represented another leap forward in engine technology that improved upon the 350r. Despite publicized teething difficulties in the early stages, the current lineup is a solid spacecraft design that promises exceptional speed, and has proven it time and time again with multiple Murray Cup wins. In the late 2930's, the UEE Advocacy purchased a bulk of these racers to convert into interdiction ships.</p>
