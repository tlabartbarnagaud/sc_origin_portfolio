    <h2 id="history">History</h2>

    <p>The 600i is based on the previous 600 line, manufactured in the 29th century. The line originally began as a function first mid-sized transport. One heavily modified original 600 ship was used by Captain Iggy Decarlo in the Tohil Regatta race on Tohil III, and served as a rescue ship during the environmental catastrophe at Amidon Island. Only as Origin refined their version of luxury after moving to Terra, they went back to the drawing board to bring the 600 in line with Origin's iconic aesthetic. Engineers used the same chassis as before but made major changes to the interior's shape language, used better materials, and added expensive diamond laminate panels to create an observation deck. It was put into full-scale production in 2947, and they added an "i" to the ships name to symbolize the upgrade.</p>

        <li><span>Exploration Module:</span> The Exploration Module is designed to bring luxury and comfort to those long-haul exploration missions in deep space. In addition to the Explorer module's comprehensive scanning array and utility hardpoints, this module offers an increased cargo capacity to make sure you have all the room you need for extra supplies or for bringing back more discoveries. The bridge contains a mapping table and additional slots for avionics and utility systems. The Exploration Module also adds a garage with a deployable ramp for ground exploration.</li>
