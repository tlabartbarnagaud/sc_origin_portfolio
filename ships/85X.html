    <h1>85X</h1>

    <h2>Model</h2>

    <p>Elegantly styled and meticulously constructed, the Origin 85X is a small 2-person snub craft that functions as an away vessel for the 890 Jump. It is included with purchases of the 890.</p>
    <p>Whether descending down to the planet surface or taking in the sights of your system, the 85x will continue Origin's proud tradition of turning heads. It combines the power of a racer with the reliability of a touring ship.</p>

    <h4>Features</h4>
    <p>MicroTech's Providence system allows personalized access to the 85X's systems, but also stays in contact with the 890 Jump to make sure that the pilot is constantly up to date on your ship's status.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The 85X was originally known as the Model XVB, one of many racer prototypes for the Origin Racing Team. It went through rigorous testing alongside other cutting-edge speedsters to find that edge in competitive racing. Although Origin ultimately selected the model that would become the M50, the XVB was not forgotten and found new life as a companion ship for the 890 Jump.</p>
